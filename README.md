## About This Version
This repository has been **modified for testing purposes only**. Training-related functionalities have been removed. The goal of this version is to allow easy evaluation of repetition counting models without requiring additional training steps.

## Installation
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create and activate a virtual environment
Run the following commands to set up a virtual environment:
```bash
conda create -n repcount python=3.8
conda activate repcount
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Install dependencies
All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them, run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Install Additional Dependencies
Since some dependencies require special installation, install them separately:
```bash
python -m pip install detectron2 -f https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/detectron2/wheels/cu111/torch1.10/index.html
pip install -e git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorchvideo.git@fae0d89a194a2c1ca99e59eab6eedd40bde38726#egg=pytorchvideo
mim install mmcv-full
```

## Dataset & Pretrained Model Download
### üìÇ **Dataset**
Place datasets in the following directories:
- **RepCount dataset:** `data/RepCount/`
- **UCF101 dataset:** `data/UCFRep/`

Datasets can be downloaded from:
- [RepCount dataset](https://svip-lab.github.io/dataset/RepCount_dataset.html)
- [UCF101 dataset](https://www.crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php)

### üî• **Pretrained Model**
Download the pretrained model and place it in the `models/pretrained_models` directory.
- [VideoMAE pretrained encoder](https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/pyslowfast/masked_models/VIT_B_16x4_MAE_PT.pyth)

## Running the Model for Testing
Use the `test_model.py` script to evaluate the model on a given video:

```bash
python test_model.py --dataset 'RepCount' --resource 'cpu'
```

Modify the `--resource` argument to `'cuda'` if running on GPU.

### Expected Output
The script will output:
```
Overall MAE: X
OBO: X
```
